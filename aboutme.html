        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Since I was about as young as I can remember, 
            I have been playing drums. I took drum lessons 
            at a young age and have been playing ever since. 
            My most enjoyable time was the time I spent in the 
            Bearcat Marching band here at NWMSU. High-school 
            marching band was fun, but nowhere close to college.

        <p>
            To be honest, I don't really read many books. This one
            is probably just the most memorable out of the ones I've 
            ever read.
